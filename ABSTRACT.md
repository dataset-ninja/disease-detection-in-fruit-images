The authors of the **Disease Detection in Fruit Images** dataset utilized 74 images containing apple fruits to assess the effectiveness of their proposed neural network. These images featured single or multiple apples, with at least one of them being afflicted by *anthracnose*. The disease manifests as rounded symptoms with varying sizes and visible pattern variations. A skilled expert marked the regions of these rounded symptoms on apple fruits using bounding boxes, providing the ground-truth labels for the study. A total of 182 bounding boxes were created, ranging from 1 to 9 per image. The apple images varied in size from 500x700 to 3000x2000 pixels, while disease symptom sizes ranged from 50x50 to 2000x1400 pixels.
